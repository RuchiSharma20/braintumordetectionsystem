An intelligent method for detecting and classifying brain diseases such as tumors and normal brain imaging.


**Abstract:** 
The brain is the most important organ in our body, as it regulates the rest of our organs. Brain disorders have been recognized as the world's second leading cause of mortality. If they are not detected early and treated appropriately. Early discovery and diagnosis of the tumor may aid and save the patient's life.Advances in technology and biology are increasing the early identification, categorization, surgical treatment, and medical care of a wide spectrum of human illnesses. We built an intelligent method for detecting and classifying brain diseases such as tumors, and normal brain imaging. In addition, to improve treatment procedures and patient care, we have been trying to increase the quality and sensitivity of imaging in the early diagnosis of illnesses ranging to brain tumors disease.


**Introduction:**

The need for a tumor detection program, thus, overcomes the lack of qualified radiologists. Brain tumour detection and localization are made simpler by biomedical image processing using magnetic resonance imaging. This work used pictures from the MRI sequence as an input image to construct a segmentation and detection approach for brain tumours, identifying the tumour region. The enormous range of tumour tissues present in the presence of various patients makes this procedure challenging, and in most situations, the similarity among normal tissues makes the work challenging. The major objective is to identify if the brain has a brain tumour or is healthy.
To enhance performance and streamline the segmentation of medical images, the suggested method is built on a deep learning classifier using CNN model.


**Technologies** 

•	We are using the CNN[convolution neural network] model using deep learning architecture by leveraging 2D convolutional neural networks for the classification of different types of brain tumor from MRI and CT scans image slices.
•	We have used python with machine learning for backend work and html, CSS, Java script for the frontend code.
•	We have used the platform Visual studio codes for the coding platform.  
 
**Conclusion** 

Early on in the process of training a neural network for use in medicine, model explainability should be taken into account since it may eventually assist doctors incorporate the network's predictions into a therapeutic decision. One of the greatest methods for assessing the picture collection is CNN. By enlarging the picture without losing the information required for prediction, CNN produces the forecast. Using picture augmentation techniques and examining the performance of the CNN can get the same results. The amount of layers and filters that may be employed in a model will eventually be decided using optimization approaches. Our CNN model currently outperforms other methods in predicting the existence of brain tumours for the dataset in question.
 
**Future Scope** 
The age of big data in medicine is rapidly coming due to the speedy advancement of medical technology. The prediction, monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy of tumour problems are strongly influenced by the analysis and mining of this data. The brain tumour is recognised as the deadliest and most destructive illness due to its wide variety of characteristics, short survival rate, and aggressive nature. Brain tumours that are incorrectly identified result in subpar medical care, which lowers the patient's likelihood of survival. Due to the ability to discriminate between abnormal and normal tissues, detecting brain tumours is extremely difficult. A proper diagnosis enables the patient to get effective treatment and survive over the long term.
Because of the peculiar pattern of lesion distribution, there are still certain detection limits for brain cancers despite substantial study. It might be challenging to locate an area with a few lesions since tiny portions frequently appear to be healthy. It immediately lowers classification accuracy, therefore picking and extracting informative characteristics is difficult. The automated classification of early-stage brain cancers using deep and machine learning techniques contributes significantly. This study suggests using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and forecast brain malignancies using a hybrid deep learning model called Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) (MRI). We test using a collection of MRI brain images. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to extract the important characteristics once the data has been effectively preprocessed from images.
